As a KPI and Success Metrics Analyst, my role is to define clear, measurable indicators that will determine whether the "Data-Driven Personalization for Loan Products" project has achieved its objectives.

Given the objective: "Design a solution that uses customer data to personalize and improve the visibility, relevance, and uptake of loan products on the mobile Banking app," the KPIs and acceptance criteria should cover visibility, engagement, conversion, and customer satisfaction, while also considering operational aspects.

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for Loan Personalization Project

The KPIs are categorized to reflect different stages of the customer journey and business impact.

**A. Visibility & Engagement KPIs:**

    *   **Definition:** The percentage of active mobile banking users who are presented with personalized loan product recommendations within the app.
    *   **Why it's important:** Measures the reach and visibility of the new personalization feature.
    *   **Calculation:** (Number of unique users shown personalized recommendations / Total number of active mobile banking users) * 100

2.  **Click-Through Rate (CTR) on Personalized Loan Offers:**
    *   **Definition:** The percentage of users who click on a personalized loan recommendation after being presented with it.
    *   **Why it's important:** Measures the initial relevance and attractiveness of the personalized offers.
    *   **Calculation:** (Number of clicks on personalized recommendations / Number of personalized recommendation impressions) * 100

3.  **Engagement Rate with Loan Product Details:**
    *   **Definition:** The percentage of users who click on a personalized loan offer and then spend a minimum amount of time (e.g., 30 seconds) or view a minimum number of screens (e.g., 2 screens) on the respective loan product's details page.
    *   **Why it's important:** Indicates deeper interest beyond just a click, showing the user is exploring the product.
    *   **Calculation:** (Number of users engaging with loan details / Number of clicks on personalized recommendations) * 100

**B. Conversion & Uptake KPIs:**

4.  **Loan Application Initiation Rate (from Personalization):**
    *   **Definition:** The percentage of users who start a loan application after interacting with a personalized loan recommendation.
    *   **Why it's important:** Direct measure of increased intent to apply due to personalization.
    *   **Calculation:** (Number of loan applications initiated from personalized recommendations / Number of clicks on personalized recommendations) * 100

5.  **Loan Application Completion Rate (from Personalization):**
    *   **Definition:** The percentage of initiated loan applications (from personalized recommendations) that are fully completed and submitted.
    *   **Why it's important:** Measures the effectiveness of the personalized offer in driving actual submissions, considering friction in the application process.
    *   **Calculation:** (Number of completed loan applications from personalized recommendations / Number of loan applications initiated from personalized recommendations) * 100

6.  **Loan Disbursement Rate (from Personalization):**
    *   **Definition:** The percentage of completed loan applications (from personalized recommendations) that result in a successfully disbursed loan. This is the ultimate business outcome.
    *   **Why it's important:** The true measure of revenue generation and increased loan portfolio.
    *   **Calculation:** (Number of disbursed loans from personalized recommendations / Number of completed loan applications from personalized recommendations) * 100

7.  **Average Loan Value (from Personalization):**
    *   **Definition:** The average principal amount of loans disbursed that originated from personalized recommendations.
    *   **Why it's important:** Provides insight into the financial impact beyond just the number of loans; indicates if personalization is driving uptake of higher-value products.
    *   **Calculation:** Total principal amount of disbursed loans from personalization / Number of disbursed loans from personalization

**C. Customer Experience & Quality KPIs:**

8.  **Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT) related to Personalization:**
    *   **Definition:** Average score from in-app surveys or feedback mechanisms asking users about the relevance and usefulness of personalized loan recommendations.
    *   **Why it's important:** Ensures that personalization is perceived positively and not as intrusive.
    *   **Calculation:** Average score on a 1-5 or 1-10 scale (e.g., "How relevant were the loan recommendations?")

9.  **Recommendation Accuracy Score (Internal KPI):**
    *   **Definition:** An internal metric measuring how accurately the recommendation engine predicts customer needs, based on a validation set or A/B testing feedback.
    *   **Why it's important:** Ensures the underlying data and algorithm are working effectively to drive relevant offers.
    *   **Calculation:** (Number of correct recommendations / Total recommendations) * 100 (requires defined "correctness" criteria).

### Acceptance Criteria

These criteria define the specific targets that must be met for the project to be considered a success. Baseline data (current performance without personalization) is crucial for setting realistic and impactful targets.

**A. Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Success Criteria (Initial Launch):**

1.  **Personalized Loan Offer Impression Rate:**
    *   **Acceptance:** Achieve at least **70%** of active mobile banking users being exposed to personalized loan recommendations within 2 weeks of feature launch.

2.  **Click-Through Rate (CTR) on Personalized Loan Offers:**
    *   **Acceptance:** The CTR on personalized loan offers must be at least **2.5x higher** than the average CTR of generic loan product banners/promotions prior to personalization, within the first month. (e.g., if generic CTR was 0.5%, target 1.25%).

3.  **Loan Application Initiation Rate (from Personalization):**
    *   **Acceptance:** A minimum of **5%** of users who click on a personalized loan offer initiate an application within the first two months.

4.  **Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT) related to Personalization:**
    *   **Acceptance:** Maintain an average CSAT score of **at least 7/10** (or equivalent) for questions related to personalization relevance and usefulness within the first three months. No significant increase in negative app store reviews related to recommendations.

5.  **Recommendation Accuracy Score:**
    *   **Acceptance:** The internal recommendation accuracy score (as per model evaluation) must be **at least 75%** before general release and maintained above **70%** post-launch.

**B. Optimized Success Criteria (3-6 Months Post-Launch):**

1.  **Loan Application Completion Rate (from Personalization):**
