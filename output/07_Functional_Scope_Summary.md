Okay, as a Business Analyst, here is a functional scope summary (in-scope/out-of-scope) for the loan personalization project, designed to increase uptake through the mobile banking app.

## Functional Scope Summary: Loan Product Personalization on Mobile Banking App

**Project Goal:** To increase the visibility, relevance, and uptake of existing loan products (Home, Personal, Auto, Educational, Foneloan) by leveraging customer data for personalized recommendations within the mobile banking application.

### In-Scope:

The following functionalities and components are considered within the scope of this project:

1.  **Customer Data Integration & Processing:**
    *   **Data Collection & Ingestion:** Establishment of secure data pipelines to collect and ingest relevant customer data from *internal bank systems* (e.g., core banking system, transaction history, CRM, past loan applications/inquiries, existing loan details, demographic data, mobile app usage logs, utility payment history, fund transfer patterns, balance inquiry frequency).
    *   **Data Transformation & Cleansing:** Processes to clean, normalize, and transform raw data into a usable format for the personalization engine.
    *   **Data Storage:** Secure and scalable storage for the processed customer data, optimized for analytical processing.

2.  **Personalization Engine Development:**
    *   **Eligibility & Propensity Modeling:** Development and implementation of algorithms/machine learning models to:
        *   Assess customer eligibility for specific loan products based on pre-defined bank criteria (e.g., income, credit score indicators, existing relationships).
        *   Predict customer propensity/likelihood to take up certain loan products based on behavioral patterns and demographic data.
    *   **Recommendation Logic:** Development of rules and algorithms to generate personalized loan product recommendations based on the eligibility and propensity models. This includes logic for ranking, filtering, and prioritizing recommendations.
    *   **Real-time/Near Real-time Processing:** Capability for the personalization engine to process data and generate recommendations with minimal latency to ensure relevance.

3.  **Mobile Banking App Integration & UI/UX:**
    *   **Dedicated Loan Recommendation Section:** Creation of a prominent, dedicated section within the mobile banking app to display personalized loan offers and recommendations.
    *   **Contextual Placement:** Display of relevant loan recommendations/banners/notifications at appropriate touchpoints within the app (e.g., after a high-value fund transfer, approaching educational season, within balance inquiry screens, or upon login).
    *   **Call-to-Action (CTA):** Clear and intuitive CTAs guiding users directly to the loan application process for the recommended products.
    *   **Pre-filled Application Forms:** Where permissible and data is available, pre-filling of relevant customer information (e.g., name, address, contact details) into the loan application form to reduce friction.
    *   **"Why this loan?"/Eligibility Overview:** Provision of brief, clear information explaining why a particular loan might be suitable for the customer (e.g., "Based on your salary," "For your home purchase"). *This will be high-level and not disclose sensitive credit assessment details.*
    *   **Opt-out/Feedback Mechanism:** A basic mechanism for users to indicate disinterest in a specific recommendation or provide simple feedback, to help refine future recommendations.

4.  **Performance Tracking & Analytics:**
    *   **Recommendation Performance Metrics:** Tracking of key metrics such as views, clicks, applications started, and conversion rates for personalized loan recommendations versus generic loan product pages.
    *   **A/B Testing Capability:** Ability to run A/B tests on recommendation algorithms, UI placements, and messaging to optimize performance.
    *   **Dashboard & Reporting:** Development of internal dashboards and reports for bank product managers and marketing teams to monitor the effectiveness of the personalization engine and loan uptake.

5.  **Security & Compliance:**
    *   **Data Privacy:** Ensuring full compliance with relevant data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA, local banking regulations) regarding customer data collection, storage, and usage for personalization.
    *   **Security Measures:** Implementation of robust security protocols to protect sensitive customer data and prevent unauthorized access.
    *   **Audit Trails:** Logging and auditing of all data access and recommendation generation processes.

### Out-of-Scope:

The following functionalities and components are explicitly excluded from the scope of this project:

1.  **Development of New Loan Products:** This project focuses on increasing uptake of *existing* loan products. Creation of new loan types or modification of existing loan product features (e.g., interest rates, terms & conditions) is out of scope.
2.  **Overhaul of Core Loan Origination System (LOS):** While integration with the LOS for application submission and status updates is in scope, a fundamental redesign or replacement of the bank's core LOS, its credit assessment rules, or the loan approval/disbursement workflows is out of scope.
3.  **Personalization for Non-Loan Products:** Personalization or recommendation efforts for other banking products (e.g., credit cards, investment products, savings accounts, insurance) are out of scope.
4.  **Offline (Branch/Call Center) Personalization:** This project is specifically focused on personalizing the customer experience *within the mobile banking application*.
5.  **Integration with External Third-Party Data Sources:** The personalization engine will primarily leverage *internal bank data*. Integration with external credit bureaus or other third-party data providers for enhanced credit scoring is out of scope for this initial phase.
6.  **Automated Loan Approval/Disbursement:** The project aims to increase the initiation of loan applications. Automated credit approval, underwriting, or direct disbursement of funds without human intervention or existing LOS processes are out of scope.
7.  **Full Mobile App Redesign:** While specific UI/UX enhancements will be made to integrate the personalization features, a complete redesign or re-platforming of the entire mobile banking application is out of scope.
8.  **Advanced AI Chatbots/Conversational AI:** Development of complex AI-driven chatbots or virtual assistants for answering loan-related queries or guiding users through the application process conversationally is out of scope.
9.  **Predictive Analytics for Churn or Fraud Detection:** While valuable, these specific types of predictive analytics fall outside the primary objective of loan product personalization and are considered separate initiatives.
