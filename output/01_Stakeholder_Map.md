To effectively design a solution for improving loan product uptake through data-driven personalization, it's crucial to identify and understand all relevant stakeholders. A Stakeholder Map helps categorize individuals or groups based on their influence over the project and their interest in its outcome.

Here's a Stakeholder Map in Mermaid format for the loan personalization project:

**Explanation of Stakeholder Categories:**

1.  **Primary Stakeholders (High Influence, High Interest):** These are the individuals or groups who have direct authority over the project, fund it, and are ultimately responsible for its strategic success. Their strong interest aligns with the bank's overall objectives.
    *   **Executive Leadership:** Provide strategic direction, allocate resources, and ensure alignment with the bank's vision.
    *   **Product Owners (Loans):** Define the loan products, their features, target markets, and KPIs for success. They are direct beneficiaries of increased uptake.

2.  **Key Enablers & Implementers (High Influence, High Interest):** These teams are critical for the practical execution and technical delivery of the personalization solution. Without their expertise and effort, the project cannot proceed.
    *   **Mobile App Development Team:** Responsible for implementing the UI/UX changes and integrating the personalization logic into the mobile app.
    *   **Data Science & Analytics Team:** Core to the project; responsible for data collection, analysis, building personalization algorithms, and providing performance insights.
    *   **IT Operations & Infrastructure:** Ensures the underlying systems, databases, and security measures are robust enough to support the new data-intensive features.

3.  **Governance & Oversight (High Influence, Managed for Compliance/Risk):** These teams ensure the project adheres to all internal policies, external regulations, and maintains the bank's risk appetite. They have high influence as they can halt or significantly alter the project.
    *   **Risk Management Team:** Ensures the personalized recommendations align with credit risk policies and promote responsible lending.
    *   **Compliance & Legal Team:** Ensures adherence to data privacy laws (e.g., GDPR, CCPA), fair lending practices, and other financial regulations.
    *   **Internal Audit:** Provides independent assurance that processes and controls are adequate and effective.

4.  **Impacted & Engaged (High Interest, Varying Influence):** These stakeholders are directly affected by the changes or will interact with the new features. Their feedback is crucial for refinement and adoption.
    *   **Customers / Users:** The ultimate beneficiaries and target audience. Their adoption and satisfaction are the primary measures of success.
    *   **Marketing Team:** Will leverage the personalization capabilities for targeted campaigns and communications to customers.
    *   **Customer Service / Call Center:** Will need to be informed about new features to support customer inquiries and provide valuable feedback on customer reactions.
    *   **Branch Network / Loan Officers:** While the project focuses on digital uptake, these traditional channels may be impacted by shifts in customer behavior and can offer insights from the ground.

5.  **External Stakeholders (High Influence, Indirect Interest):** These are entities outside the bank that have regulatory power or significant influence over the bank's operations.
    *   **Regulatory Bodies:** Govern banking practices, including data usage, lending practices, and consumer protection. Their guidelines must be strictly followed.
