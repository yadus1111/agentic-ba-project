### 1. Introduction

#### 1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this Functional Requirement Specification (FRS) is to detail the functional and non-functional requirements for the development and implementation of a data-driven personalization engine and associated features within the mobile banking application. The primary goal is to enhance the visibility, relevance, and ultimately, the uptake of various loan products (e.g., home loans, personal loans, auto loans, educational loans, foneloan) by offering personalized recommendations to customers based on their historical data and real-time engagement patterns. This document will serve as a definitive guide for design, development, testing, and deployment teams.

#### 1.2 Scope
This project focuses on leveraging existing customer data to generate and display personalized loan product recommendations within the bank's mobile banking application.

**In Scope:**
*   **Data Integration:** Collection and aggregation of relevant customer data from internal bank systems (e.g., Core Banking System, CRM, Transactional Data, previous loan inquiries).
*   **Customer Profiling:** Development of a capability to create dynamic customer profiles based on aggregated data.
*   **Recommendation Engine:** Implementation of algorithms (rules-based, machine learning-driven) to generate personalized loan product recommendations.
*   **Mobile App Integration:** Display of personalized loan recommendations prominently on the mobile app home screen and/or a dedicated section.
*   **Recommendation Interaction:** Features allowing users to view details, initiate an application, and provide feedback on recommendations.
*   **Application Pre-fill:** Auto-population of known customer data into loan application forms within the app.
*   **Notifications:** Push notifications and in-app alerts for relevant loan offers or updates.
*   **Performance Monitoring:** Backend capabilities for the bank to track the effectiveness of recommendations (clicks, conversions).

**Out of Scope:**
*   Full end-to-end loan origination system (beyond the initial application pre-fill and submission).
*   Integration with external credit bureaus for real-time credit scoring logic (it will *consume* pre-existing scores or eligibility criteria).
*   Marketing campaigns outside the mobile banking app (e.g., SMS, Email, direct mail, social media ads).
*   Development of new loan products.
*   Full redesign of the entire mobile banking application (focus is on loan features).

### 4. Assumptions

*   The bank has an existing, stable mobile banking application infrastructure capable of integrating new features.
*   Necessary historical customer data (transactional, demographic, product holdings, past loan inquiries) is available and accessible from existing core banking systems, CRM, and data warehouses/lakes.
*   Data quality from source systems is generally reliable and fit for purpose for customer profiling and recommendations.
*   The bank has clear, documented eligibility criteria for all existing loan products.
*   There is executive sponsorship and adequate budget and resources allocated for the project.
*   Regulatory approvals for data usage and personalized communication are either already in place or will be secured in a timely manner.
*   The bank has sufficient IT infrastructure capacity to host the new personalization engine and associated databases.

### 5. Constraints

*   **Timeline:** Project delivery must align with the bank's digital transformation roadmap, targeting a go-live within 6-9 months.
*   **Budget:** Development and infrastructure costs must remain within the allocated budget of [Specify Budget Range if known, e.g., $X million].
*   **Existing Systems:** Integration must adhere to existing security protocols and API standards of the core banking system and other internal systems. Minimal disruption to existing live systems is paramount.
*   **Data Privacy:** All data handling must comply strictly with national and international data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, local banking privacy laws). No Personally Identifiable Information (PII) should be exposed unnecessarily.
*   **Mobile App OS Support:** New features must be compatible with the last two major versions of iOS and Android operating systems.
*   **User Interface Guidelines:** New UI elements must conform to the bank's existing mobile app design system and brand guidelines.
