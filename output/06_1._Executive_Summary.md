# 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines the business requirements for enhancing the mobile banking application to significantly improve the uptake of loan products (home, personal, auto, educational). While the mobile app boasts high overall engagement, loan product conversion remains low. The proposed solution leverages advanced customer data analytics to personalize loan offerings, improve their visibility, and ensure their relevance to individual customer needs and financial situations. This initiative aims to drive revenue growth, enhance customer satisfaction, and strengthen the bank's digital lending capabilities.
