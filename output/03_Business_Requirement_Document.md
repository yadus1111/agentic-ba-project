## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Purpose

The purpose of this Business Requirements Document (BRD) is to define the business needs, objectives, and high-level requirements for the development and implementation of a data-driven personalization and recommendation engine for loan products within the bank's mobile banking application. This document will serve as a foundational guide for the project team, ensuring alignment between business goals and the technical solution. It will be used by product owners, IT development teams, quality assurance, and other stakeholders involved in the project lifecycle.

### 1.2. Scope (High Level)

This project focuses on enhancing the mobile banking application (iOS and Android) to provide personalized, relevant, and timely recommendations for the bank's existing loan products (e.g., home loans, personal loans, auto loans, educational loans, foneloan). The personalization will leverage various internal customer data sources to improve visibility, relevance, and ultimately, the uptake of loan products.

### 1.3. Audience

This document is intended for:
*   Project Sponsor & Senior Management
*   Product Management Team
*   Marketing Team
*   IT Development & Architecture Teams
*   Quality Assurance Team
*   Data Analytics Team
*   Legal & Compliance Team
*   Customer Service Management

## 2. Business Need / Problem Statement

The bank currently offers a comprehensive suite of loan products through its mobile banking application. However, despite high overall mobile app engagement for features like utility payments, fund transfers, and balance inquiries, the uptake and application rates for loan products remain significantly low.

The current approach presents loan products in a generic, static list or through manual, untargeted promotions. This results in:
*   **Low Visibility:** Loan products are not prominently displayed to relevant customers.
*   **Irrelevance:** Customers are presented with all loan products, many of which may not be suitable or timely for their specific needs, leading to cognitive overload and disengagement.
*   **Missed Opportunities:** The bank possesses rich customer data (transaction history, demographics, app usage patterns, credit scores, etc.) that is not being effectively utilized to identify and present relevant loan solutions proactively.
*   **Inefficient Marketing:** Generic marketing efforts yield low conversion rates.

This unoptimized customer journey translates into lost revenue opportunities, reduced customer satisfaction, and a missed chance to deepen customer relationships by fulfilling their financial needs proactively.

## 3. Business Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are to:

1.  **Increase Loan Application Conversion Rate:** Achieve an X% increase in initiated loan applications via the mobile app within Y months post-launch. (e.g., 15% increase in initiated applications within 6 months).
2.  **Improve Loan Product Uptake:** Increase the successful loan disbursement rate by Z% from mobile app-originated applications within Y months post-launch. (e.g., 10% increase in successful disbursements within 6 months).
3.  **Enhance Customer Engagement:** Increase click-through rates (CTR) on loan product sections/recommendations by A% and reduce bounce rates from the loan section by B% within Y months. (e.g., 20% increase in CTR, 15% reduction in bounce rate within 3 months).
4.  **Boost Customer Satisfaction:** Improve customer perception of the mobile app's ability to meet their financial needs, aiming for an increase in Net Promoter Score (NPS) related to personalized services.
5.  **Optimize Marketing Efficiency:** Leverage data to automatically target customers with relevant offers, reducing reliance on broad-based, less effective campaigns.

*Note: Specific percentages (X, Y, Z, A, B) will be determined during the project's planning phase with input from Product Management and Marketing.*

## 4. Success Metrics

The success of this project will be measured by tracking the following Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):

*   **Loan Application Conversion Rate:** (Number of initiated loan applications / Number of unique visitors to the loan section) * 100
*   **Loan Disbursement Rate:** (Number of successful loan disbursements / Number of initiated loan applications) * 100
*   **Click-Through Rate (CTR) on Recommendations:** (Number of clicks on recommended loan products / Number of impressions of recommended loan products) * 100
*   **Engagement Rate with Loan Section:** Time spent on loan pages, number of pages viewed within the loan section.
*   **Bounce Rate:** Percentage of users who navigate away from the loan section after viewing only one page.
*   **Loan Product Diversity:** Increase in applications across a wider range of loan products, not just popular ones.
*   **Customer Feedback:** Qualitative feedback, app store reviews, support tickets related to loan products.
*   **Net Promoter Score (NPS):** Changes in overall customer satisfaction.

## 6. Current State Analysis

Currently, the mobile banking app's loan section operates as a static catalog. Users typically navigate to a "Loans" or "Apply for Loan" section, where they encounter a list of all available loan products. Each product has a brief description, and users must click into each one to view detailed eligibility criteria, interest rates, and application steps.

*   **Discovery:** Relies heavily on the customer actively searching for a loan or seeing a generic in-app banner/advertisement.
*   **Information Overload:** A user interested in a loan might have to sift through multiple irrelevant options (e.g., a student viewing home loan offers).
*   **Lack of Proactive Engagement:** The system does not anticipate customer needs or leverage their existing data to present timely and relevant offers.
*   **Inefficient Customer Journey:** Customers spend significant time navigating, comparing, and determining eligibility, often leading to frustration and abandonment.
*   **Manual Targeting:** Any personalized marketing is usually done via email/SMS campaigns, not dynamically within the app based on real-time behavior.

## 7. Future State / Proposed Solution Overview

The proposed solution involves integrating a **Data-Driven Personalization and Recommendation Engine** into the bank's mobile banking application. This engine will leverage various customer data points to intelligently identify and present the most relevant loan products to each individual user.

**Key Components:**

1.  **Data Ingestion & Processing:** Securely collect and process customer data from various internal sources (see Appendix 14.2).
2.  **Recommendation Engine (ML/AI):**
    *   Utilizes Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to analyze customer data patterns.
    *   Generates personalized loan product recommendations based on:
        *   **Eligibility:** Pre-qualified criteria (credit score, income, existing liabilities, employment status, age).
        *   **Customer Needs & Life Events:** Identified through transaction patterns (e.g., high spending on education-related items suggests educational loan interest, frequent car maintenance suggests auto loan potential, recent property tax payments suggest home loan).
        *   **Behavioral Data:** Past interactions with loan products, app usage patterns, searches, clicks, time spent on pages.
        *   **Demographics:** Age, occupation, family status.
        *   **Existing Product Holdings:** Current accounts, savings, other loans.
    *   Will include business rules for hard constraints (e.g., minimum income for home loan).
3.  **API Integration:** A robust API layer will connect the recommendation engine with the mobile banking application to deliver real-time personalized content.
4.  **Dynamic UI/UX:** The mobile app interface will be updated to prominently display personalized loan recommendations in strategic locations (e.g., home screen banner, dedicated "For You" section, context-aware prompts).
5.  **A/B Testing Framework:** Enable the ability to test different recommendation algorithms, UI placements, and messaging to continuously optimize performance.
6.  **Analytics & Reporting Dashboard:** Provide insights into recommendation performance, customer engagement, and conversion metrics.
7.  **Consent Management:** A clear and compliant mechanism for obtaining user consent for data usage for personalization.

The solution aims to transform the mobile banking loan experience from a static catalog to a dynamic, intelligent, and proactive financial advisory service.
