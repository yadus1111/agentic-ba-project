# Out of Scope

The following functionalities and areas are **not** included in this project:

*   **Development of New Loan Products:** This project focuses on improving uptake of *existing* loan products. Any new loan product development or significant changes to existing product features are out of scope.
*   **Overhaul of Core Banking or Loan Origination Systems:** This project assumes the existing CBS and LOS are stable and will primarily integrate with them. Major architectural changes or re-platforming of these systems are excluded.
*   **Manual Underwriting Process Changes:** While the application process is streamlined digitally, the core manual underwriting decisions and processes that occur within the LOS are not subject to change within this project's scope.
*   **Website (Web Banking) Enhancements:** The focus is exclusively on the *mobile banking app*. Changes to the web banking portal for loan uptake are not part of this initiative.
*   **Customer Service Agent Tools:** While insights from this project may inform customer service, the development of new or enhanced tools for customer service agents to view or process loans is out of scope.
*   **Offline Channels:** Any improvements or changes to in-branch or call center loan application processes are not included.
*   **Third-Party Data Acquisition Strategy:** While the CDAE can utilize credit bureau data, the strategic initiative to onboard new third-party data providers is outside this project's scope.
*   **Comprehensive Financial Planning Tools:** This project does not aim to build full-fledged financial advisory or planning tools within the app, beyond presenting relevant loan products.
