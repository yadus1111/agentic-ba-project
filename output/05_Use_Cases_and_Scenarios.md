The bank aims to leverage its rich customer data to address the low uptake of loan products through its mobile banking app. The core idea is to personalize loan recommendations, making them more visible and relevant to individual customers, thereby driving higher conversion rates.

As a Use Case Analyst, I will develop use case diagrams and detailed scenarios for the following three key cases:

1.  **Receive Personalized Loan Recommendations:** How the customer views relevant loan suggestions upon logging into the app.
2.  **Explore Recommended Loan Product:** How the customer delves into the details of a specific recommended loan.
3.  **Apply for Recommended Loan:** How the customer initiates and completes an application for a recommended loan product.

## 2. Detailed Use Case Scenarios

### Use Case 1: Receive Personalized Loan Recommendations

*   **Use Case ID:** UC-L001
*   **Use Case Name:** Receive Personalized Loan Recommendations
*   **Actors:** Customer, Loan Recommendation Engine (System), Core Banking System, Credit Bureau
*   **Description:** This use case describes how the mobile banking app displays personalized and relevant loan product recommendations to the customer based on their profile, financial behavior, and eligibility.
*   **Preconditions:**
    *   Customer has an active account with the bank.
    *   Customer has downloaded and registered for the mobile banking app.
    *   The Loan Recommendation Engine is operational and has recent customer data.
*   **Triggers:**
    *   Customer logs into the mobile banking app.
    *   Customer navigates to the "Loans" or "Dashboard" section of the app.
*   **Basic Flow (Main Success Scenario):**

    1.  **Customer Logs In:** The Customer opens the mobile banking app and successfully logs in (UC-L004: Authenticate User).
    2.  **System Initiates Data Retrieval:** The Mobile Banking App sends a request to the Loan Recommendation Engine to fetch personalized loan recommendations for the logged-in customer.
    3.  **Loan Recommendation Engine Gathers Data:**
        *   The **Loan Recommendation Engine** queries the **Core Banking System** to retrieve the customer's:
            *   Basic profile (age, occupation, address, existing relationships with the bank).
            *   Account balances (savings, current accounts).
            *   Transaction history (salary credits, utility payments, fund transfers, large purchases, investment activity – as indicated by the prompt).
            *   Existing loan products and repayment history.
        *   The **Loan Recommendation Engine** queries the **Credit Bureau** (e.g., CIBIL) to retrieve the customer's external credit score and history.
        *   The **Loan Recommendation Engine** also considers the customer's *mobile app engagement data* (e.g., features used, pages visited, search queries within the app related to loans, time spent on specific sections).
    4.  **Loan Recommendation Engine Processes Data:** The **Loan Recommendation Engine** uses its algorithms (e.g., collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, rule-based systems, machine learning models) to:
        *   Assess the customer's financial health and capacity.
        *   Identify potential life events or needs based on transaction patterns (e.g., frequent utility payments might suggest a need for a home loan, large transfers for education might suggest an educational loan).
        *   Match the customer's profile and inferred needs against available loan products and their eligibility criteria.
        *   Prioritize and rank suitable loan products for the customer.
    5.  **System Displays Recommendations:** The Mobile Banking App receives the ranked list of personalized loan recommendations from the Loan Recommendation Engine. It displays these prominently on the customer's dashboard or a dedicated "Loan Offers" section. The display includes:
        *   Loan product name (e.g., "Home Loan," "Personal Loan").
        *   Key benefit/call to action (e.g., "Pre-approved up to ₹X," "Special Rate for You").
        *   A clear "Learn More" or "Apply Now" button for each recommendation.
    6.  **Customer Reviews Recommendations:** The Customer views the displayed loan recommendations.
*   **Alternative Flows:**
    *   **AF-1.1: No Suitable Recommendations:**
        *   Step 4: If the Loan Recommendation Engine identifies no suitable loan products based on eligibility or risk assessment, it informs the Mobile Banking App.
        *   Step 5: The Mobile Banking App displays a message such as "No personalized loan offers available at this time. Please check back later." or "Explore our full range of loan products."
    *   **AF-1.2: System Error/Data Unavailable:**
        *   Step 3: If any external system (Core Banking, Credit Bureau) or the Loan Recommendation Engine is temporarily unavailable, the system notifies the customer.
        *   Step 5: The Mobile Banking App displays an error message: "Unable to fetch recommendations. Please try again later."
*   **Postconditions:**
    *   Customer has viewed personalized loan recommendations on their mobile app.
    *   Customer has acknowledged the absence of recommendations (if AF-1.1 occurs).
*   **Business Rules:**
    *   Loan eligibility criteria must be strictly adhered to by the recommendation engine.
    *   Credit score checks must comply with regulatory requirements.
    *   Data privacy and consent for using customer data must be maintained.

    *   **Credit Bureau:** External credit score, credit history, existing loans with other institutions.
    *   **Mobile App Analytics:** App usage patterns, frequently used features (utility payments, fund transfers, balance inquiries), pages visited, search queries within the app, time spent on different sections.
