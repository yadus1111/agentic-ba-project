# 2. Problem Statement

The current mobile banking app, despite its high usage for transactional activities and other features, exhibits low conversion rates for loan product applications. This is primarily due to:
*   Generic, non-personalized display of loan products.
*   Lack of proactive or timely presentation of relevant offers.
*   Customers being unaware of suitable loan options or their pre-qualification status.
*   The application process potentially perceived as cumbersome or requiring too much manual input.
These factors collectively hinder customers from discovering and applying for loans that could meet their financial needs, leading to missed revenue opportunities for the bank.
