# Agentic Business Analysis Dashboard

## Recent Improvements

- üñºÔ∏è **High-Resolution Diagrams**: All Mermaid diagrams are now generated as high-resolution PNGs (2000x900, 3x scale) for maximum clarity in both the dashboard and PDF.
- üìê **Responsive Diagram Scaling**: Diagrams scale up to nearly the full page width (max-width: 95vw, max-height: 80vh, min-width: 400px, min-height: 200px) for readability, both in the Gradio dashboard and exported PDF.
- üö´ **No Generic Intros**: Any generic introductory paragraph (e.g., "Here is a complete business analysis report...") is automatically removed from the start of the report.
- üé® **Professional, Monochrome Look**: The dashboard and PDF use a unified, formal black/gray color palette and Times New Roman font for all content.
- üñ®Ô∏è **Pixel-Perfect PDF Export**: PDF export uses Playwright to render the HTML with injected CSS, ensuring the PDF matches the dashboard exactly.

An AI-powered dashboard for generating comprehensive business analysis reports using specialized AI agents.

## Features

- ü§ñ **Multi-Agent AI System**: 7 specialized AI agents working together
- üìä **Visual Diagrams**: Automatic Mermaid diagram generation
- üìã **Complete Reports**: BRD, FRS, use cases, data mapping, and KPIs
- üé® **Modern UI**: Beautiful Gradio interface with animations
- üîÑ **Error Resilience**: Automatic retries and fallback mechanisms

## How to Use

1. Enter your business problem in the text area
2. Click "Generate Report" 
3. Get a comprehensive business analysis with:
   - Stakeholder maps
   - Process flows
   - Business requirements
   - Use case diagrams
   - Data mapping sheets
   - KPIs and metrics

## Workflow & Code Overview

### How It Works

1. **User Input**:  
   - The user enters a business problem or objective into the Gradio web interface.

2. **AI-Powered Report Generation**:  
   - The core function `generate_report_and_images` takes the business problem and crafts a detailed prompt for Google Gemini (via the Gemini API).
   - The AI generates a comprehensive business analysis report in Markdown, including:
     - Stakeholder maps
     - Process flows
     - BRD, FRS, and NFRs
     - Use case diagrams and scenarios
     - Data mapping tables
     - Functional scope
     - KPIs

3. **Diagram Rendering**:  
   - The report includes Mermaid diagram code blocks.
   - The code extracts these blocks and uses the Mermaid CLI to render them as PNG images, which are then embedded back into the report.

4. **Error Handling & Resilience**:  
   - The system automatically retries up to 3 times if the AI API is overloaded.
   - If a Mermaid diagram fails to render, fallback diagrams or warnings are inserted.

5. **Output**:  
   - The final report (with diagrams) is displayed in the Gradio UI, ready for download or further use.

### Key Code Components

- **`app.py`**:  
  - Main application file containing all functionality
  - `generate_report_and_images(business_problem)`: Main function for generating the report and diagrams.
  - `extract_and_render_mermaid(md_text, ...)`: Finds Mermaid code blocks and renders them as images.
  - `insert_use_case_diagrams(...)`: Ensures each use case scenario has a unique diagram.
  - `gradio_dashboard()`: Launches the Gradio web interface.

- **`config.py`**:  
  - Stores the default Gemini model name.

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: Gradio
- **AI Model**: Google Gemini 2.5 Flash
- **Diagrams**: Mermaid.js
- **Architecture**: Multi-Agent System

## Setup Required

Add your Gemini API key as a secret in Hugging Face Spaces:
- Go to Settings ‚Üí Secrets
- Add: `GEMINI_API_KEY` = your_api_key_here

## Running the Application

```bash
python app.py
```

The application will launch a Gradio web interface that you can access locally or share publicly.

## Deployment & Auto-Deployment Workflow

### GitHub to Hugging Face Auto-Deployment

This project is configured for automatic deployment from GitHub to Hugging Face Spaces. Here's how the workflow works:

#### 1. Development Workflow
```bash
# Make your code changes locally
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push origin main
```

#### 2. Automatic Deployment Process
- GitHub Push: When you push changes to the `main` branch on GitHub
- GitHub Actions Trigger: The `.github/workflows/hf-sync.yml` workflow automatically runs
- Hugging Face Sync: Changes are automatically pushed to your Hugging Face Space
- Auto-Build: Hugging Face Spaces automatically rebuilds and deploys your application

#### 3. Configuration Required
To enable auto-deployment, you need to set up:

Option A: GitHub Actions (Recommended)
1. Add HF_TOKEN Secret to your GitHub repository:
   - Go to your GitHub repo ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions
   - Click "New repository secret"
   - Name: `HF_TOKEN`
   - Value: Your Hugging Face access token (get from https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens)

Option B: Direct GitHub Integration
1. Go to your Hugging Face Space: https://huggingface.co/spaces/Yadu-sharma/ba-agent-dashboard
2. Click Settings ‚Üí Repository
3. Enable Sync with GitHub repository
4. Connect your GitHub repository

#### 4. Live Application
- Hugging Face Space: https://huggingface.co/spaces/Yadu-sharma/ba-agent-dashboard
- Auto-updates: Every push to GitHub automatically updates the live application
- No manual deployment needed: The entire process is automated

#### 5. Benefits
- ‚úÖ Zero-downtime deployments
- ‚úÖ Automatic version control
- ‚úÖ Easy rollback (just revert a commit)
- ‚úÖ Consistent deployment process
- ‚úÖ Public access to your application
